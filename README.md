## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Inst'Inc follows a **client-server architecture** with the following layers:

```
Frontend (React.js)  <---->  Backend API (Express.js & Node.js)  <---->  Database (MongoDB)
                                       |
                                       +---> Cloudinary (Image Storage)
                                       |
                                       +---> WebSockets (Real-time chat)
```

* **Frontend (React.js):** User interface, routing, and dynamic components.
* **Backend (Express.js + Node.js):** Handles API requests, authentication, and real-time communication.
* **Database (MongoDB):** Stores user data, posts, comments, and chat histories.
* **Cloudinary:** Efficient, secure image hosting and optimization.
* **WebSockets:** Enables persistent, low-latency chat communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, Axios, WebSockets (Socket.IO), CSS/Tailwind (if used)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT, bcrypt, Cookie-Parser, Socket.IO
* **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM)
* **Cloud Services:** Cloudinary (for media storage)
* **Security:** JWT-based auth, cookie/session management, password hashing
* **Deployment:** Render (both frontend & backend)

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PORT=4001
   ```

5. **Build the application (if needed):**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Start the server:**

## üß© Configuration Notes

* Make sure the **MongoDB** and **Cloudinary** credentials are updated in the `.env` file.
* Adjust **CORS settings** if deploying on a custom domain.
* WebSocket (Socket.IO) requires correct origin settings when deploying.

---

## üåê Deployment

Inst'Inc is deployed on **Render**.
For deploying your own version:

* Use services like **Render**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify** for the frontend.
* Deploy backend to **Render**, **Railway**, or any Node.js hosting provider.
* Ensure both services are correctly linked via environment variables for API and WebSocket connections.
